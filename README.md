Tourist demand modelling based on terrorist attacks and war

Scripts used to analyze the effect of war and terrorist attacks on tourist arrivals in Kurdistan region of Iraq are deposited in this repository. Also the datatsets are available to re-perform the analysis.

First run the R script (stats.R) to get results from the sturcutral breaks and estimate the duration of war period. The script also plots the outcome for visual interpretation:

Next, run the python script to get results from the OLS models on the effect of different variables on tourism demand including terrorist attacks and wars.
